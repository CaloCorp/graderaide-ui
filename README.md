# Graderaide - UI

Based on the CONTENT of the two `html` pages in this repo, come up with a NEW (better!) design that has three different layouts

1. A mobile layout
2. A tablet layout
3. A desktop layout.

We want not just the design (which needs approval), but the implementation in pure html/css!


Guidelines

* The dimensions of those views are up to you.
* Everything about the design is up to you, but does require approval from an instructor before you can implement it.


That's it. Have at thee!
